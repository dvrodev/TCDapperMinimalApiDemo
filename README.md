Tim Corey's Dapper Minimal API Demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tYSO5mAjXs

Minimal APIs are a new feature in .NET 6 and we are in the process of exploring them. In this two-part series, we are building a complete application that consists of a SQL database, a data access layer using Dapper, and a Minimal API on the front-end. This is part 2, where we wire up our Minimal API for full CRUD access. If you missed part 1, go back and check it out.</br>
